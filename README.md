# NOVA CHEMICALS - GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

## Project URL

[GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of **NOVA CHEMICALS'** website using **GitHub Actions** and **GitHub Pages**. The website showcases the company's services in chemical trading and distribution while implementing an automated **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** workflow.

## Key Features

- **Automated Deployment:** Changes made to the `index.html` file are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Aesthetic Design:** Uses pastel colors (Alice Blue, Lavender Web, Baby Blue Eyes) for a clean and professional look.
- **Service Offerings:** Lists all the key services provided by NOVA CHEMICALS.
- **Easy Contact:** Includes company email, phone, and address for inquiries.

## How It Works

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - A GitHub repository is created with `index.html`, `README.md`, and a workflow file (`deploy.yml`).
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Every time the `index.html` file is updated in the `main` branch, GitHub Actions triggers the deployment process.
3. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, making updates accessible at:
     ```
     https://<your-username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/
     ```

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions** for automation
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **HTML & CSS** for website structure and styling
- **CI/CD Concepts** for continuous deployment
